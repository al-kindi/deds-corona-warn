      This is a simulation of the digital contact tracing using the Corona-Warn-App.<br>

      In the simulation pane, the movement of people can be seen. Any person can be selected with a click and
      their own ID as well as the ones collected locally from people passed are shown.<br>

      The ones reported to the RKI and stored on the server are shown too.
      If a user becomes infected all users who met them are informed and quarantine off the simulation pane.<br>

      The parameters of the simulation can be tuned below and the use off the app turned on and off.<br>

      Leftmost is the start/stop button for pausing the simulation. To its right the use of the app can be turned on and off.<br>

      The amount of people, their speed, distance at which the apps registers a contact as well as the infectiousness of the
      virus can be tuned with the sliders to the buttons right.

      Left is the smallest, right the largest value.<br>
