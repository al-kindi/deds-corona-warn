### Running the simulation:
All required libraries are already included. In order to run the simulation, open index.html in your browser. The  simulation should start right away.   
  
If you do not see the simulation running, you might have to run an http-server. In that case, please follow the below steps:   
Install http-server on macOS via brew:
```
$ brew install http-server
```   
Or, install http-server via npm:
```
$ npm install http-server
```

After successfully installing http-server, run the simulation:
```
$ cd deds-corona-warn-app
$ http-server ./
```  
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser. The simulation should start running immediately.   

A description of how to use the simulation is included on the webpage and in order to completely reset it, please simply reload the page. 

We hope the simulation is instructive and you find its visualization helpful.
